Java Snake Game

Welcome to the classic Snake Game implemented in Java! This retro-inspired game lets players control a snake that continuously moves around the screen. The objective is to eat the "apples" that appear, growing the snake longer with each apple consumed. However, players must be careful not to collide with the walls or, more importantly, with the snake's own body. As the game progresses, the snake will become longer and maneuvering becomes more challenging, requiring strategic planning and quick reflexes.

Features:

Simple and intuitive controls: Use arrow keys to direct the snake's movement.
Score tracking: Keep track of the number of apples eaten, challenging players to beat their high score.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, displaying the final score and offering the option to restart the game.
Colorful graphics: Enjoy vibrant visuals and smooth animations that add to the gaming experience.
How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to direct the snake.
Eat the apples by moving the snake over them.
As the snake consumes apples, it grows longer.
Avoid running into walls or the snake's body.
Keep playing to achieve a higher score and challenge your friends!
